# ToDO
I had  to do a C# project for my Software Engineering class, so I made this quick website from react and C#. I used axios to connect the API. To run this:
go to terminal
cd TODO
cd todo-client #frontend
npm run start
cd .. 
cd TodoApi
dotnet run

go to your webbrowser and type in "http://localhost:3000/"
